# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

It will take text and spit out the word count and character count per character.

Next step is to figure out how to sort the dictionaries and print a pretty report for it.
Then I'll be figuring out how to make it analyze different arguements instead of the one specific txt file.

Will this be in the main branch or the wip branch? Let's find out!
